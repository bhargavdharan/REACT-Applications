# what is useState ?

## --- useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.

## --- (we pass the initial state to one function and it returns a variable with the current state value and another function to update this value.)

### --- the main advantage of useState hook is --> inside a function component, you can create a state without switching to class components.
